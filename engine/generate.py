"""Deterministic, no-LLM site-content generator for the private-practice template.

Reads a practice's data (practice.json) + the neutral template placeholders
(template_blocks.json) and emits a generated.json that the proven fill.py engine
consumes. 23 of the 37 template blocks are kept verbatim (fill.py substitutes
their {{tokens}} and strips the AI-GENERATE markers itself); the other 14 are
resolved here from real data — including the deterministic personalization
blocks (hero headline, hero sub, pull quote) driven by the unboxing answers.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (see citations.py for the long form):
  * Modalities resolve against a curated catalog with REAL foundational
    references. An unknown modality is OMITTED, never given a fabricated source.
  * The "how I work" method and the phased journey come from a generic,
    evidence-informed bank that makes no proprietary or efficacy claim — the
    honest floor when there is no LLM to author a signature method.
  * Every emitted string is run through an honesty linter that rejects
    percentages, "proven/guaranteed", "studies show", testimonials, "cure",
    "#1", etc. If any block trips it, NOTHING is written and we exit non-zero.

Output is intentionally NOT byte-identical to any golden fixture: the golden is
a structural reference (block ids, find strings, array arities); this engine
produces a different, honest, per-practice payload of the same shape.

Pure stdlib. Run: python3 engine/generate.py --practice <p.json> --out <out.json>
