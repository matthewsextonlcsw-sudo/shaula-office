"""build_practice — turn a short therapist *survey* into a full practice.json.

This is the porcelain↔plumbing bridge. A therapist answers ~15 human questions
in the dashboard; this module deterministically expands those answers into the
complete set of {{tokens}} the fill engine needs (53 canonical tokens + the
cosmetic `upload` marker), deriving and defaulting everything else.

Design rules (honest by construction):
  * NEVER fabricate a branded method. The no-LLM floor always ships a GENERIC
    method label (`method_name` neutral, `method_acronym` ""). A real signature
    method is an LLM-enrichment deliverable, not something the floor invents.
    (a deliberate design decision.)
  * NEVER invent license numbers, outcomes, or modalities. Unknown optional
    fields become "" (the template + resolvers omit them) — never a guess.
  * Crisis lines default to the US national 988 + Crisis Text Line — public,
    correct, life-safety. (Manifest: 988/911 hard-coded for US practices.)
  * Every produced value is run through the SAME banned-claim linter the rest
    of the engine uses (imported from generate.py — single source of truth). A
    dishonest operator input (e.g. a tagline with "proven, #1, 95%") raises
    HonestyError before any file is written.

The output is a plain dict / JSON object — identical in shape to the hand-authored
fixtures, so it flows straight through generate.py → fill.py → render_check.
