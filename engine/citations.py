"""Curated clinical reference + content banks for the deterministic site generator.

THE HONESTY CONTRACT (read before editing):
  * Every modality listed here carries a REAL foundational reference. If a
    practice names a modality that is not in MODALITIES, the generator OMITS it
    rather than inventing a citation. Never add an entry with a fabricated or
    guessed source.
  * The `what` blurbs describe what a modality does in plain language. They make
    no efficacy promises ("proven", "guaranteed", percentages, testimonials).
    The honesty linter in generate.py will reject those words on sight, so keep
    this file clean too.
  * The generic METHOD_STEPS / JOURNEY_PHASES banks are the no-LLM floor: a
    sound, general, evidence-informed therapeutic arc (regulate -> notice ->
    understand -> practice -> integrate -> sustain) that is TRUE for essentially
    any talk-therapy practice. They deliberately do NOT claim to be a named,
    proprietary method. A bespoke "GROUND Method" page requires an LLM to author
    the signature clinical content; without one we present an honest general
    framework (a deliberate scope limit).

Pure stdlib. Importable; also runnable (`python3 citations.py`) for a self-test.
