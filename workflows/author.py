"""author — therapist self-serve workflow authoring (plain language -> kanban + skill).

The therapist describes a job in their own words; Shaula drafts a WorkflowTemplate
whose steps are assigned ONLY to vetted office staff, runs it through the SAME
guardrails the hand-authored templates pass (``workflows.builder.validate`` —
assignee allow-list + PHI gate + honesty lint + acyclic DAG), and hands back a
kanban task-graph (``build_plan``) for the therapist to review and approve. It can
also draft a reusable SKILL pack — honest guidance CONTENT attached to a vetted
profile — for the job.

THE LINE WE DO NOT CROSS (builder.py's invariant, kept verbatim):
  Therapists COMPOSE vetted staff and author honest CONTENT. They CANNOT mint a new
  agent with new tools or powers. A drafted workflow is a PROPOSAL — a non-vetted
  assignee is REJECTED by validate(), never executed, and the workflow runs only
  after a human approval gate. A drafted skill is guidance text run through the real
  honesty gate — never a new capability with filesystem / network / tool access.

Generation model is pluggable: Vertex ``gemini-2.5-flash`` in prod (via svc.gemini),
local Ollama for synthetic dev/proof (workflows.local_executor.OllamaModel). The
model is UNTRUSTED — every byte it returns is validated by builder.validate and the
honesty gate before it can become a task or a skill. Pure stdlib, no new deps.
