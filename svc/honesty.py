"""honesty — the Reviewer's voice (UX audit SH-F12).

The engine linter (engine/generate.py:lint) is the single source of honesty
truth and a HARD stop — this module never weakens it, never auto-repairs a
claim, and never adds a second linter. What it adds is narration: when the
gate fires, the therapist should read "your Reviewer refused a guarantee-style
claim — here is the sentence" instead of a raw regex fragment.

Three audiences, three strictness levels:

  * ``explain``        → the run's ``honesty.reasons`` record: which rule, in
                         plain words, with the offending sentence QUOTED. The
                         quote lives in run STATE (like every step output —
                         marketing copy, no PHI); it is never logged.
  * ``refusal_message``→ step-output-safe summary. Step outputs are pinned by
                         contract to never contain banned text, so this string
                         must not echo the claim OR the banned vocabulary.
  * ``revise_note``    → the one-click "rewrite without this claim" note that
                         feeds the revision loop (SH-F3) when the clinician
                         asks for changes without typing one.

NO PHI. Stdlib only.
